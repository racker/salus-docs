# Introduction to new system
### Describe workflow:
* monitors
* resources
* events

### So what has changed?
* Checks -> monitors with labels (What does this mean for them?)
* Entities -> resources with labels
* Alarms -> Events with labels
* Did we mention that labels were important?
* Aric/CORE processing  -> Moogsoft (briefly mention that moogsoft will amalgamate tickets)

## Admin dashboard

## Common debugging
* So a customer was expecting a monitor to be on a particular server
* This one server is very specific and I donâ€™t want to create labels just to bind a monitor straight to this server
